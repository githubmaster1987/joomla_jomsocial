PREAMBLE

The GPL Friendly Media License is a software and media license of the company: 

MAD4MEDIA 
Dipl. Informatiker(FH) Fahrettin Kutyol 
Amerikastraße 21 
66482 Zweibrücken 
Germany.

Hereinafter the license and copyright holder shall be shortened by `Mad4Media`.
Hereinafter this licenses name shall be shortened by `GFML`.

Mad4Media offers a variety of products and services. 
The range includes proprietary and free software/ media files.
Free Mad4Media products are commonly offered under the GNU GPL v2.0 license why 
the name of this license uses `GPL`. The GFML may also apply to software packages 
which are not GPL licensed but use a different free license. 

As one of the core competence of Mad4Media is to create high end media elements 
such as graphics, cascading style sheets, videos in combination with high end 
media scripts such as JavaScript, Actions Script™, Shockwave™ and other various 
media files which are combined in browsers; this license offers the free community 
to take advantage of such media files which are normally proprietary. 

By the GFML Mad4Media allows users to use the media files within GPL based 
software packages without restricting the freedom of GNU GPL but likewise protects 
the interests of Mad4Media to offer unique service and high quality products 
and is used for quality assurance. 


DEFINITIONS

Media files: Media file refers to any image, audio, video, data containers, cascading
style sheets, text files and software which can be used on a computer. The definition 
of Media file in the meaning of the GFML applies to files which are located standalone 
on a server /computer and get compiled in a browser or any other displaying device.

Package License: Media files under GFML are only intended to be part of a software 
package. The GFML requires that the parent license must be a free license such as for 
GNU GPL, GNU LGPL, BSD, MIT etc.  

Viral License: Viral license is a copyright / copyleft license that allows derivate 
works only when licensed under the same or compatible license to the original. 
Especially GNU GPL allows dynamic linking to GPL licensed software (-parts) if the 
linking software / code is compatible to GPL.


COPYRIGHT

The copyright holder of GFML licensed media files is Mad4Media – All rights reserved.
As a copyright holder Mad4Media has the right to determine freely its products.
Mad4Media reserves the right to offer software, parts of software, source code and 
media -files in other license types. Mad4Media prohibits the use of GFML licensed 
software and media if the using party is violating the law or is used for any fraudulent 
or criminal action. 


INTERACTION WITH GNU GPL AND OTHER VIRAL LICENSES

Following the definition of media files in the meaning of GFML and as stated by the GPL 
version 2.0 the elements of a software package that are not compiled together but are sent 
independently of GPL (or other viral license) code, and combined in a client’s browser 
( displaying/processing device), do not have to be GPL themselves.  
Based on this the GFML is compatible to GPL and commonly to other viral licenses. 


SECURING THE GPL (FREE LICENSE) FREEDOMS

GFML does not force that all media files must be part of the software package.
In GPL or other free licensed software packages all GFML media files may be removed 
and replaced by own media files under a different license.
